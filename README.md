#### OVERALL FINDINGS & IMPLICATIONS

#### FINDINGS
• Platform – Linux and Windows remain the most desired platforms.

• Web Frameworks – React.js and Vue.js have increased in popularity while interests in jQuery have dropped significantly.

• JavaScript and PostgreSQL remain the most popular Programming Language and Database tool respectively.

• More Male than Female are in the Tech Space. This could be a sign of gender discrimination.

• USA ranks highest in the Technology space.

• Majority of the Tech experts fall within the age of 15 and 42 years.

#### IMPLICATIONS

• Equal opportunities should be given to both genders in the Tech space.

• Age shouldn’t necessarily be a barrier when venturing into Tech.

• There is need to expose the trend in Technology to more countries and they should all have equal opportunity to participate.

• The trend in Technology is ever changing, and every programmer, regardless of their domain should be open-minded and flexible enough to adapt to these changes.

## CONCLUSION

1. The trend in Technology is constantly changing. As a result, quality Personnel management is key to ensuring adequate upskilling for more demanding skills and growing trends.

2. The Tech Space should be accommodating regardless of Age, Gender, and Location. 

3. Adequate Budgeting plan is vital in ensuring resources are channeled to the right skill for improved performance.
